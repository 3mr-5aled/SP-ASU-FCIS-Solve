# Structured Programming Course Repository

This repository contains my solutions for the Structured Programming course at Ain Shams University, Faculty of Computer and Information Sciences.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following main sections:

- **Home Assignment**: Solutions for assigned homework problems
- **Practice**: Lab practice files and exercises
- **Sheets**: Solutions for the problem sheets provided during the course

## Topics Covered

The code in this repository demonstrates various concepts in C++ programming:

- Basic syntax and control structures
- One-dimensional arrays
- Functions and parameter passing
- Structures
- Two-dimensional arrays
- Matrix operations
- Dynamic memory allocation
- File handling

## Notable Files

### Home Assignments

- Home Assignment 7 - Product management system with dynamic memory allocation
- Home Assignment 3 - Menu-driven product inventory system using structures

### Practice Labs

- Lab 9 - Working with structures and dynamic memory
- Lab 7 - Matrix operations (transpose and multiplication)
- Lab 6 - Arrays and functions with pass by reference

### Problem Sheets

- Sheet 8 (Solution) - Binary conversion and array manipulation
- Sheet 6 - Matrix operations including identity check and mirroring
- Sheet 3 - Various structure implementations (Cinema, House, Student)

## Usage

Most programs can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler like g++:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename
./filename
```

## Learning Outcomes

Through these assignments, I've learned:
- Structured programming principles
- Problem-solving techniques using C++
- Memory management
- Data structures implementation
- Modular programming using functions
- How to create and manipulate complex data using structures

## Course Information
